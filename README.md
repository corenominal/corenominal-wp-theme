# corenominal WordPress Theme

**This is my [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) theme, there are many like it, but this one is mine!**

## Notes

* This theme is a work in progress, use at your own risk. If you do use it, please do not blame me if your WordPress installation explodes. Actually, you can blame me, but I'll shirk all responsibility.

* This theme is now live and can be viewed at https://corenominal.org. The theme has reached [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) stage and I intend to blog about its continued development on [my site](https://corenominal.org).

* I'm not intending to accept feature requests, but if you notice that I have done something dumb (*it does happen, occasionally*), please feel free to fix it and submit a pull request.

Thanks for reading! :)
