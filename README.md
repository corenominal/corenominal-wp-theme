# corenominal WordPress Theme

**This is my [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) theme, there are many like it, but this one is mine!**

## Notes

* This theme is a work in progress, use at your own risk. If you do use it, please do not blame me if your WordPress installation explodes. Actually, you can blame me, but I'll shirk all responsibility.

* This theme is not live, yet, but when I pull my finger out, it will be live at https://corenominal.org, which is also known as the centre of the Internet. My intention is to get the theme to [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) stage, make it live, then blog about its continued development.

* I'm not intending to accept feature requests, but if you notice that I have done something dumb (*it does happen, occasionally*), please feel free to fix it and submit a pull request.

Thanks for reading! :)
